# Smart-Anti-Squirrel-Bird-Feeder
Active anti squirrel bird feeder arduino code.
Code for Anti Squirrel Bird Feeder using two servo motors, rotary encoder, MPU-6050. This project was my capstone for my undergraduate mechatronics engineering 
degree completed in April 2023. The project was only for one semester, and for 3D printing inquiries check out my thingiverse page for the STL files 
and build this yourself! Thingiverse profile is Mark_Mattei and the project is Smart Anti-Squirrel Bird Feeder. 
Descriptions are provided there to ensure everything works properly. NOTE* if you dont use a rotary encoder - you can remove the section in the code involving the arduino interrupts and encoder feedback operation.
